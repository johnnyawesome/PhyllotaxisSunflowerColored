A Colored Version of the Phyllotaxis Sunflower

## Background
This Phyllotaxis Pattern is loosely based on [this tutorial video from Dan Shiffman.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWoJgHFYWxY)
However, I found the Sine / Cosine part a bit confusing, so my version just rotates the grid with rotate() to get the same effect.

## Alternative projects
There are three total Phyllotaxis Projects I made

- You can find [an uncolored version, written in Processing here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/PhyllotaxisSunflowerPattern)  

- There is also a colored version of the same Processing sketch [available here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/PhyllotaxisSunflowerColored)

- [And there is a P5JS Version which is available here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/phyllotaxisP5JS)
